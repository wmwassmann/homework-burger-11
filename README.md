## Test:
Once you have installed the npm packages and have connection to the server via the 'schema.sql' file and MySQL Workbench, copy and paste the 'seed.sql' file into Workbench and run it. Refresh your tables in Worlbench. Then in your directory, run 'node server.js' and you'll have test code display in console.tables formatting to test the app with.

## Note: 

I have no idea how to get CSS to work with Handlebars...Still trying to figure that one out.
